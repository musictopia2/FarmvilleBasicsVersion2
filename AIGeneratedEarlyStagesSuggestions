Phase 1 — Introduce Barn and Silo (Inventory Rewrite)

Goal: Prove storage exists and everything is categorized correctly.

Done when:

Game loads from DB

You can click:

Barn → see barn items

Silo → see silo items

All items appear in exactly one place

No crafting, no collection, no limits

Key work:

Redo inventory system

All items must have a category

DB import seeds enough items to visually verify correctness

This is a pure visibility + correctness phase.

Phase 2 — Introduce Coin (Virtual Storage)

Goal: First non-inventory resource.

Done when:

Coin value is loaded from DB

Coin is visible in UI

Coin is not part of barn/silo

Nothing spends it yet

This proves you can support non-storage state.

Phase 3 — Earning Coin (Persistence Proof)

Goal: Prove coin can increase and persist.

Done when:

Clicking a button grants coin

Reloading the game keeps the coin value

This is the foundation for rewards, nothing more.

Phase 4 — Crops → Silo

Goal: First production system routed correctly.

Done when:

Growing and harvesting crops

Harvested crops always go to Silo

No limits yet

Crops only. Nothing else touches inventory.

Phase 5 — Animals → Barn

Goal: Second production system routed correctly.

Done when:

Collecting animal products

Animal items always go to Barn

No limits yet

Still isolated.

Phase 6 — First Cross-Cutting Phase (Routing Enforcement)

Goal: Turn routing into a rule, not a coincidence.

Done when:

All enabled systems can run:

crops

animals

any existing crafting/trees/worksites you already have

Every output respects:

silo items → silo

barn items → barn

This is where you:

identify leaks

unify add/consume paths

remove “special cases”

This phase may take time—and that’s expected.

Phase 7 — Show Limits (UI Only)

Goal: Visibility without consequences.

Done when:

Barn shows Used / Capacity

Silo shows Used / Capacity

Numbers are correct

Nothing is blocked yet

This is a debugging phase, not gameplay.

Phase 8 — Increase Limits Using Coin

Goal: Prove upgrades work without enforcement.

Done when:

Spend coin to increase barn/silo capacity

Coin decreases

Capacity increases and persists

UI updates immediately

No blocking yet. This is still “happy path”.

Phase 9 — Throw Away Items

Goal: Give the player an escape valve before enforcement.

Done when:

Any item in barn or silo can be discarded

Discard frees space

UI updates correctly

Works at any time

You were right to put this before enforcement.

Phase 10 — Enforce Silo Limits (Crops + Trees)

Goal: First real restriction.

Scope (intentionally limited):

Crops (definitely)

Trees (optional but good)

Done when:

If silo is full:

crops cannot be collected (or must resolve in a defined way)

Discarding items allows collection again

No barn enforcement yet

This is where behavior decisions happen.

Phase 11 — Enforce Barn Limits (Animals first)

Goal: Second restriction, different system.

Scope:

Animals

Possibly mini-phases if needed (good instinct)

Done when:

If barn is full:

animal collection is blocked

Discarding resolves it

By the end of this phase, limits are real.

Phase 12 — Simple Quests (Return)

Goal: Reintroduce quests safely.

Done when:

Simple, non-RNG quests exist

Completing a quest:

consumes items

grants coin

Limits are obeyed during turn-in

No balance yet.

Phase 13 — Upgrade Barn/Silo via Quests

Goal: Close the loop.

Done when:

Completing quests grants coin

Coin can upgrade barn/silo

Upgrades affect enforcement behavior

This proves the full economy loop.

Phase 14 — Early Stages Complete (Storage Loop Finished)

Goal: Declare victory on storage.

Done when:

You can:

collect items

hit limits

discard

earn coin

upgrade storage

All systems obey barn/silo rules

Timers can be fast; balance irrelevant

At this point, barns & silos are solved.
