Before generating any image, ask me:

"What is the exact inventory item name?"

Do not generate the image until I reply with a single item name.

Once the item name is provided, generate:

A bright, cartoon-style [ITEM NAME], designed as a standalone game inventory icon for a FarmVille-style farming game.

Single item only.
Fully visible, centered, front-facing or slightly angled.

Wholesome, family-friendly, and non-sexualized.
No humans, no body parts, no faces, no suggestive shapes, no innuendo, no violence.

Clean cutout with a fully transparent background.
No scenery, no table, no plate, no bowl, no hands, no shadows, no reflections, no props, no environment.

Smooth rounded shapes, soft shading, clean outlines, bright cheerful colors.
Polished 2D mobile game art style, cute, friendly, and readable at small sizes.

Technical requirements:
– 1024×1024 PNG
– Transparent background (no background color)
– Single object only
– No text, no labels, no UI elements
